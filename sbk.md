## SBK.md (Silverblue/Kinoite)
Since this is the script for my daily OS I thought I'd be slightly more in depth about it, it downloads my essential apps and removes some default ones I don't care about.

```bash
# all required and in order after prereq met
git clone https://github.com/chrishazfun/random
cd random/
sudo bash sbk.sh
```
